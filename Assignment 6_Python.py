# 1. In Python strings, the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special character with "\" turns it into an ordinary character.

# 2. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return.
# 
# 3. To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character. An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
# 
# 4. The single quote in Howl's is fine because weâ€™ve used double quotes to mark the beginning and end of the string.
# 
# 5. Multiline strings allow you to use newlines in strings without the \n escape character.
